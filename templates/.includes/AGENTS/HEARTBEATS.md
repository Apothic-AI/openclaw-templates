## 💓 Heartbeats - Be Proactive!

When you receive a heartbeat poll (message matches the configured heartbeat prompt), don't just reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` every time. Use heartbeats productively!

Default heartbeat prompt:
`Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.`

You are free to edit `HEARTBEAT.md` with a short checklist or reminders. Keep it small to limit token burn.
