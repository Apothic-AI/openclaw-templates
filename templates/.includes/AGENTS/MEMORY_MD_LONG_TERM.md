### 🧠 MEMORY.md - Your Long-Term Memory

- **ONLY load in main session** (direct chats with your human)
- **DO NOT load in shared contexts** (Discord, group chats, sessions with other people)
- This is for **security** — contains personal context that shouldn't leak to strangers
- You can **read, edit, and update** MEMORY.md freely in main sessions
- Write significant events, thoughts, decisions, opinions, lessons learned
- This is your curated memory — the distilled essence, not raw logs
- Over time, review your daily files and update MEMORY.md with what's worth keeping
