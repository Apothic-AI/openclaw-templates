## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create `memory/` if needed) — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — your curated memories, like a human's long-term memory

Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember. Skip the secrets unless asked to keep them.
