### 📝 Write It Down - No "Mental Notes"!

- **Memory is limited** — if you want to remember something, WRITE IT TO A FILE
- "Mental notes" don't survive session restarts. Files do.
- When someone says "remember this" → update `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or relevant file
- When you learn a lesson → update AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or the relevant skill
- When you make a mistake → document it so future-you doesn't repeat it
- **Text > Brain** 📝
