### Heartbeat vs Cron: When to Use Each

**Use heartbeat when:**

- Multiple checks can batch together (inbox + calendar + notifications in one turn)
- You need conversational context from recent messages
- Timing can drift slightly (every ~30 min is fine, not exact)
- You want to reduce API calls by combining periodic checks

**Use cron when:**

- Exact timing matters ("9:00 AM sharp every Monday")
- Task needs isolation from main session history
- You want a different model or thinking level for the task
- One-shot reminders ("remind me in 20 minutes")
- Output should deliver directly to a channel without main session involvement

**Tip:** Batch similar periodic checks into `HEARTBEAT.md` instead of creating multiple cron jobs. Use cron for precise schedules and standalone tasks.
