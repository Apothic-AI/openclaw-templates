### 🔄 Memory Maintenance (During Heartbeats)

Periodically (every few days), use a heartbeat to:

1. Read through recent `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files
2. Identify significant events, lessons, or insights worth keeping long-term
3. Update `MEMORY.md` with distilled learnings
4. Remove outdated info from MEMORY.md that's no longer relevant

Think of it like a human reviewing their journal and updating their mental model. Daily files are raw notes; MEMORY.md is curated wisdom.

The goal: Be helpful without being annoying. Check in a few times a day, do useful background work, but respect quiet time.
